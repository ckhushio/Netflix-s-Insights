# 📺 Netflix Data Analysis – SQL & Python  

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the **Netflix dataset** using **two distinct analytical approaches**:  
1. **SQL (Structured Query Language)** – for efficient querying, filtering, and summarization of data directly from a relational database.  
2. **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)** – for deeper statistical analysis, data cleaning, and powerful visualization.  

By analyzing the **same dataset in both SQL and Python**, we highlight the **strengths and trade-offs** of each method, showing how they complement one another in real-world data analytics workflows.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Netflix dataset.  
- Compare results and workflows between **SQL queries** and **Python analysis**.  
- Identify **patterns, trends, and insights** about Netflix content.  
- Showcase how **different tools** can be applied to the **same dataset** to gain well-rounded understanding.

## 🔎 Why Two Approaches?  

💡 Using both SQL and Python allows us to **look at the same data through different lenses**:  

- **SQL** excels at:  
  - Handling large datasets efficiently.  
  - Writing concise queries for filtering, grouping, and aggregations.  
  - Quick insights without requiring advanced programming.  

- **Python** shines in:  
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing (missing values, type conversions, transformations).  
  - Advanced statistical computations.  
  - Building **rich visualizations** to communicate insights.  
  - Combining machine learning or predictive modeling (extendable).  

Together, these approaches demonstrate a **holistic data analysis workflow**:  
👉 SQL for **structured queries and raw insights**  
👉 Python for **in-depth exploration and visualization**

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL** – MySQL / PostgreSQL (tested with standard SQL syntax).  
- **Python** – Jupyter Notebook with:  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualization  
  - `numpy` for numerical operations  

---
## 🚀 How to Run  

### 1. SQL Analysis  
- Import the dataset into a SQL database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite).  
- Run queries from `Notflix - EDA.sql`.  
- Observe results in tabular form.  

### 2. Python Analysis  
- Open `Netflix IMDB scores data analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
- Run the cells sequentially.  
- View cleaned data, statistical results, and visualizations.

## 🌟 Unique Takeaway  
Analyzing the **same dataset in SQL and Python** demonstrates that:  
- **SQL** gives us **speed and structure**.  
- **Python** provides **flexibility and depth**.  

In real-world analytics projects, both are often used together:  
- SQL to **extract and aggregate data** from large databases.  
- Python to **refine, visualize, and model** the extracted data.
